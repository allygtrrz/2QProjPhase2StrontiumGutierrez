            <h1>Owari no Seraph: Humans and Vampires Alike</h1>

            <p>Owari no Seraph is a Japanese dark fantasy manga written by <span class="highlight1">Kagami Takaya</span> and illustrated by <span class="highlight2">Yamamoto Yamato</span>.</p>
            <p>It is set in a post-apocalyptic world ruled by vampires after most of humanity was wiped out due to a deadly virus. The story revolves around an orphaned boy by the name of Hyakuya Yuichiro, who is determined to exterminate the vampires after his fellow orphans, or rather, his family, are brutally killed by one. Upon joining the Japanese Imperial Demon Army, he meets equally determined humans who all possess their own resolves to retaliate against the oppressive vampire race.</p>
            <p>As the story progresses, the line between humans and vampires becomes more and more blurry with both sides giving in to their greedy desires. On his journey to exterminate the vampires, Yuichiro uncovers shocking revelations that make him question whether the supposedly good human race and the supposedly evil vampire race are really any different in terms of his perception of good and evil.</p>
